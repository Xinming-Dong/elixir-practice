Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
Xinming Dong

2. What hostname did you deploy to?
Elephantdong.com

3. What's the URL of your git repo?
https://github.com/Xinming-Dong/elixir-practice.git

4. How much of the functionality did you complete?
All functions except factor(). I have finished coding. Its way of function call is similar to "calc()". However, the main page cannot jump to "factor()" result, while function "calc()" works fine. I have checked page controller and router.ex, and cannot figure out what is happening.

5. Did you successfully deploy? If not, what's broken?
No, I didn't. I successfully run deploy.sh, but the page showed on browser is somewhat wrong.

6. How comfortable do you feel with Elixir now?
Not quite.

7. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
Deploying it to my server. I am not quite familiar with Linux commands.
